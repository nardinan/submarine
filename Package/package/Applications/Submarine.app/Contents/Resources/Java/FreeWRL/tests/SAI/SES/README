This is the wrl part of a bigger case study.  The controller tries
to connect to an animation server at port 4445.  If it doesn't exists
it will run with user interaction only.

You can start a signal server that controls the signals by invoking the
following command *before* running freewrl:

CLASSPATH=. java SimulationServer
