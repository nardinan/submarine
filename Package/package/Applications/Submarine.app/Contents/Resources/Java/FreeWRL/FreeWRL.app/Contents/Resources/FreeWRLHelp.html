<P>FreeWRL -- run the FreeWRL VRML97/X3D browser</P>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>See the bottom of this text for the copyright and license.</P>
<P>This command runs the FreeWRL VRML browser.
See <A HREF="/VRML/Viewer.html">the VRML::Viewer manpage</A> for details on the user interface and 
<A HREF="/VRML/Browser.html">the VRML::Browser manpage</A> for some other things. This manual
page explains how to use the browser.</P>

<H1><A NAME="keys/mouse">KEYS/MOUSE</A></H1>
<P>FreeWRL supports, as per VRML97 spec, several different <EM>navigation modes</EM>.
In each mode, the meanings of mouse movements and keystrokes are different.</P>
<P>In addition to the keys described below, there are some keys
which work in all the modes:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_d">d</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Switch to the Fly (Keyboard input) navigation mode
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_f">f</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Switch to the Fly (External Sensor input) navigation mode
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_e">e</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Switch to the Examine navigation mode
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_w">w</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Switch to the Walk navigation mode
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_v">v</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Go to the next viewpoint in the scene
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_b">b</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Go to the previous viewpoint in the scene
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2F">/</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Print out the position and orientation of the current viewpoint
in the current Viewpoint node's local coordinate system.
<P>You can add the view you currently see in the window by creating a new
Viewpoint node (in the same coordinate system as the one you used to
go to this viewpoint) with these values.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_s">s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Save a snapshot or (with the ``-seq'' option) start/stop saving a
sequence of images. By default, snapshots are saved to
<EM>freewrl.snap.NNNN.ppm</EM> and sequences to <EM>freewrl.seq.mpg</EM>; see
options ``-gif'', ``-seqb'' and ``-snapb''. While saving images, freewrl is
slower.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_h">h</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Toggle the headlight on or off.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_q">command-q</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Quit the browser
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="walk">Walk</A></H2>
<P>Drag the mouse while mouse button 1 is pressed to move forwards/backwards
or turn.
For translation in the x-y plane press mouse button 3 and drag.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fly  keyboard mode">Fly - keyboard mode</A></H2>
<P>This mode allows translation/rotations in all planes. There are two
keymappings: those from the game Descent, and a mapping using the
keypad.</P>
<P>There is currently no mouse control, rather, all motion is controlled
by 12 keys, two for each of your 6 degrees of freedom (3 translations, 
3 rotations).</P>
<P>The default keymap in this mode is</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%278%27%2F%27k%27_and_%27Keypad_Down%27%2F%27Keypa">'8'/'k' and 'Keypad Down'/'Keypad Up'</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
rotation down/up
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27u%27%2F%27o%27_and_%27Keypad_Left%27%2F%27Keypa">'u'/'o' and 'Keypad Left'/'Keypad Right'</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
rotation left/right
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%277%27%2F%279%27_and_%27Keypad_7%27%2F%27Keypad_9">'7'/'9' and 'Keypad 7'/'Keypad 9'</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
rotation about the Z axis
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27a%27%2F%27z%27_and_%27Keypad_0%27%2F%27Keypad_%">'a'/'z' and 'Keypad 0'/'Keypad .'</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
translation forwards/backwards
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27j%27%2F%27l%27_and_%27Arrow_left%27%2F%27Arrow_">'j'/'l' and 'Arrow left'/'Arrow right'</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
translation left/right
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27p%27%2F%27%3B%27_and_%27Arrow_up%27%2F%27Arrow_">'p'/';' and 'Arrow up'/'Arrow down'</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
translation up/down
<P></P></DL>
<P>It may take a while to get used to the FLY navigation mode but it is the only
one with full freedom of motion currently.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fly  external sensor input">Fly - External Sensor input</A></H2>
<P>This mode is entered via the ``f'' key. It takes input from a file in
the /tmp directory - this file contains x,y,z and quat info, and
puts the viewpoint there.</P>
<P>As of December 17, 1999, only Polhemus code works, but Joystick 
input is literally around the corner.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="examine">Examine</A></H2>
<P>The examine navigation mode is analogous to holding an object in your
hand and rotating it to see it from various sides: your line of view
always goes through the same point but you can rotate the object and
translate yourself closer and farther away.</P>
<P>Currently, dragging with mouse button 1 pressed
rotates the scene and dragging up or down mouse button 3 pressed 
translates you towards and away from the scene. There are no other controls.</P>
<P>The center around which you rotate is determined by taking the initial
position and orientation of the viewpoint given in the VRML file. 
A ray is cast along your line of view and the closest that ray comes 
to the origin of the local coordinate system is defined as the origin
of the rotations.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="none">None</A></H2>
<P>As the name says, there is nothing you can do in the NONE navigation mode.</P>
