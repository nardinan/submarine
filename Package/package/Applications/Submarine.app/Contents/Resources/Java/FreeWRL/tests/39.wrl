		"This file build misc translucent objects
		 The object are listed in reverse Z-order to achieve the blend effect
		 Try to 'look back' the scene and the blend effect will vanish
		 because in that case the closest object is drawn first and the farest
		 last. The Z-buffer so tell that the last one is 'hidden' by the first one.
		 Objects:
		   The first object is a cone with a translucent texture (a window with colored glass).
		   The second is the same translucent window map on a square surface.
		   The third one is another square surface with another translucent image (kind of mountain ?)
		   The fourth (farest) is a not translucent sphere, which is seen across others.
