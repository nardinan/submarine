		"This is a test for alpha blending 3D objects. The blending feature is not
		 well handled as it depends on the order the objects are described in the wrl file
		 This test is the better case possible because the background is always drawn first
		 and no objects can be behind. The draw order is so always the good one.
		 Try the next test to see a more complex 3D blended scene.
