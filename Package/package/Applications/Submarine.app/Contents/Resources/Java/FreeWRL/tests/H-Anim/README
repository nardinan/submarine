H-anim tests. See:

http://www.h-anim.org/

NONE of these tests were written by me  - copyrights of course
stay with the owners, who put (should have put?) their names into
the files.

Some of these tests don't run. These are complex VRML files. Work
is being performed to make them work as best as they can - but note
that sometimes they don't even work in all of the commercial VRML
viewers....
