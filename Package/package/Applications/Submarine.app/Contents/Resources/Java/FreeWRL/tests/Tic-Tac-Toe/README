The EAI classes are a "work in progress"; and are just getting
rebuilt.

Things to watch out for:

1) sometimes the appletviewer does not shutdown correctly.

ps -aux | grep jdk

to find out if one is running, and
kill "pid" (the number of the process) to stop it.

2) the appletviewer now ignores the CLASSPATH.

Appletviewer's -J option can be used as a temporary work-around.
This option is non-standard however, and it's usage may change in the future.

In the meanwhile:

EAI=../../java/classes

sets the path to the EAI classes, and

appletviewer -J-classpath -J$EAI -J-Djava.security.policy="$EAI/java.policy" add-remove1.html

sets up the classpath, and the java security policy file needed to run the applet in
appletviewer.

3) verify all paths in the script "standalone", to run it with
the appletviewer. It assumes that both freewrl and the appletviewer
are installed and in your path.
