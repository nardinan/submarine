Updated June 2005; makes 6 objects, adds them, then removes 3, then
adds 1 back in again. Exercises add/remove and createVRMLFromString.

To compile, you may wish to cp -r the java classes over to this
directory from the FreeWRL build directory, or reference them via
the Java CLASSPATH environment variable.
