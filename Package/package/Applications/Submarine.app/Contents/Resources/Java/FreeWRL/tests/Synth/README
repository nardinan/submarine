Try #1 for the synth. It works! Future versions will have better
MIDI control, as the playmidi and midge portions will be replaced.

The Scene has 12 notes, (one octave), and 4 purple "octave selector"
cones. The red sphere is the record button, and the yellow sphere
is the play button.

run the midi_control.c program (no make file yet, just
gcc midi_control.c, and run the a.out program).

Run the script synth.

Note: midge (perl to midi program) must be in path.

Note: playmidi must be in path, and must play to synth.
