Run a command in Java.

From our buddy Rob, aka Exile in Paradise. Thanks Rob!

Check out the code, then run the wrl file within FreeWRL.
You'll have to compile the RunCommand.java file. You may
have to make sure that either your environment variable
CLASSPATH is set correctly, or that you have copied the
vrml directory here.
